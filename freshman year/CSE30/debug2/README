Errors:
Compilation errors --
1) line 60 in main.c
   (60) error: undefined symbol: numOfChars
   (60) error: variable may be used before set: numOfChars

   Original code:
   (void) printf("\"%s\" has a total of %d character(s)\n", str, 
                 numOfChars);

   Problem: 
   There is no variable numOfChars that holds the number of chars in
   the string in main.c. It is defined in count.c, but we want to use
   this variable in main.c.

   Fix:
   Add the line extern int numOfChars in main.c in order for us to 
   access the variable in count.c, on line 40.
   extern int numOfChars;


2) line 28 in count.c
   (28) error: implicit function declaration: strlen

   Original code:
   #include <stdio.h>
   #define ASCII 256
   for (i = 0; i < strlen(str); i++)

   Problem:
   We did not include <string.h> which contains strlen.

   Fix:
   Add #include on line 7.
   #include <string.h>


3) line 36 in count.c
   (36) error: function returns pointer to automatic

   Original code:
   int* count( char* str ) {
     int asctb[ASCII] = {0};
     ...
     return asctb;

   Problem:
   We are returning a pointer that will be deallocated after we end
   the function, so the memory can't be accessed outside.

   Fix:
   Make the pointer static on line 36 in count.c.
   static int asctb[ASCII] = {0};

Functionality errors --
1) Error:
   Output always says that there are 4 different ascii characters
   and only four lines are printed to the screen when there should be
   more.

   Original code (line 52):
   for (j = 0; j < sizeof(counts); j++) {

   Problem:
   Our for-loop loops only 4 times every time because we're doing while
   j < sizeof(count), but since count is an int *, the size of count
   is 4. Instead, we want to loop 256 times (once per character in the
   ASCII set).

   Fix:
   On line 52, change sizeof(counts) to ASCII.
   for (j = 0; j < ASCII; j++)

2) Error:
   We keep printing "appeared 0 times" to the screen and incrementing
   numOfUniqueChars even if counts[j] is 0.

   Original code (lines 53 to 57):
   if (counts[j]) 
      (void) printf("Character %c ", j);
      (void) printf("appeared %d times\n", counts[j]);

      numOfUniqueChars++;

   Problem:
   We don't have brackets after the if, so the if statement
   only applies to the first line. Therefore, the second line always
   prints and numOfUniqueChars always increments even if we don't
   want it to.

   Fix:
   Add brackets around the chunk of code from line 54 to 57.
   if (counts[j]) {
      (void) printf("Character %c ", j);
      (void) printf("appeared %d times\n", counts[j]);

      numOfUniqueChars++;
    }
