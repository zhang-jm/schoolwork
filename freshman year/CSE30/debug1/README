Compilation Errors
1) Error: In "reverse.s", line 29: location counter not on word boundary
   Fix:	I needed to add a .section ".text" at the top of the file 
	because I was still in the data section.
	File: reverse.s
	Line #: 13
	New code: .section ".text"


2) Error: In "reverse.o": symbol .data (section): value 0x21144 does not fit
   Fix: Instead of using mov palStr, %o0, I needed to use the set command
        because the value 0x21144 (palStr) is too large.
	File: reverse.s
	Line #: 73
	New code: set palStr, %o0
	

Runtime Errors
1) Error: Segfault
   Fix: In the save statement in "reverse.s", there was a negative missing.
        So, it said save %sp, (92 + 4) & -8, %sp instead of 
	save %sp, -(92 + 4) & -8, %sp.
	File: reverse.s
	Line #: 31
	New code: save	%sp, -(92 + 4) & -8, %sp



2) Error: Another segfault
   Fix: We need to use ldub to load a byte in the string in findEnd instead
        of using ld. 
	File: findEnd.s
	Line #: 31, 42
	New code: ldub	[%i0], %l0

3) Error: Bus Error
   Fix: No save statement in findEnd.
	File: findEnd.s
	Line #: 25
	New code: save   %sp, -96, %sp


4) Error: More segfaults
   Fix: It said that we needed to decrement endPtr, but instead of subtracting
        1 from endPtr to decrement it, we were adding 1 to it.
	File: reverse.s
	Line #: 59
	New code: sub   %l2, 1, %l2


5) Error: Program thinks every input is a palindrome.
   Fix: We needed a nop after the ba in swapChars.s. Without it, the program
        always executes the line after it, which is to set the return value 
	to 1. Because of this, we are always finding that all the characters
	are the same, so we always get a palindrome.
	File: swapChars.s
	Line #: 45
	New code: nop


6) Error: If we input a sentence, we never check the words after the first word.
   Fix: Instead of setting char * str to be argv[1], which will always get the 
        first arg/first word, we set it to i in the for loop.
	File: main.c
	Line #: 42
	New code: char * str = argv[i];
