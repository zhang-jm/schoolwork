Program Description:
This program can be run from the terminal.
The user can run this program by first opening the terminal, entering the
directory using the command "cd pa9", compiling the program using the command
"javac -cp ./objectdraw.jar:. CrittersController.java"
and finally running the program using the command
"appletviewer CrittersController.html".

This program sets up a GUI with various buttons.
The user can add different critters onto the canvas.
When started, the user is prompted to add two or more critters.
The user can add a critter by choosing the critter they want 
to add from the buttons, and then clicking on the canvas to place the critter.
If the stop button is not pressed, after two critters are placed, the critters
will move based which critter they are.
Chasers will chase after any critter that is not a chaser.
Runners will run away from any other critter.
Randoms will move randomly (not based on other critters).


Short Answer:
1) make a new class for each shape
   have a method to set color in each shape class
2) interfaces use implement keyword, abstract classes use extend keyword
   abstract classes can have method implementations while interfaces can't                 
3) they can both have abstract methods without implementation
   they are both part of a hierarchy
4) gvim -o *.java 
5) mkdir -p fooBar/barDir
