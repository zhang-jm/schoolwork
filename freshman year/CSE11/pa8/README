Program Description:
CS11Turtle_Threaded
This program can be run from the terminal.
The user can run this program by first opening the terminal, entering the
directory using the command "cd pa8", compiling the program using the command
"javac -cp ./turtleClasses.jar:. CS11Turtle_Threaded.java"
and finally running the program using the command
"java -cp ./turtleClasses.jar:. CS11Turtle_Threaded".

When the file is run, the user watches as multiple turtles draw the words
"CS11FMD FALL 2014" on three lines, as well as a background, at the
same time. 


Rational:
This program can be run in the terminal.
The user can run this program by first opening the terminal, entering the
directory using the command "cd pa8", compiling the program using the command
"javac Rational.java",
and finally running the program using the command
"java Rational".
The user can also use the provided files "TestRational.java" and 
"EC_TestRational.java" to run and test the Rational class. To do this, the
user replaces "Rational" in "Rational.java" with either "TestRational" or
"EC_TestRational".

The Rational program creates a Rational object that has a numerator and 
denominator. The user can manipulate the Rational objects to do basic
operations such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. The user
can also find the reciprocal of the Rational object, and change the
Rational object into a whole object rounding both up and down.


Short Answer: 
1) cat -b readFile (numbers non-blank output lines) or 
   cat -n readFile (numbers all output lines)
2) cat -eT readFile
   -e shows end of line
   -T shows tabs
   tabs are indicated with "^I"
   end of line is indicated with "$"
   You can tell if there's trailing whitespace if there is whitespace after
   the end of the text/code and before the "$" that indicates the end of the 
   line.
3) nl readFile
   1) spaces (?)
   2) tab
4) :set number
5) :set list
   tabs are indicated with "^I"
   end of line is indicated with "$"
   You can tell if there's trailing whitespace if there is whitespace after
   the end of the text/code and before the "$" that indicates the end of the 
   line.
6) :%s/fun/amazing/g to replace all instances
   :%s/fun/amazing to replace only the first instance in each line
