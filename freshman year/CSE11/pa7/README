Program Description:
ReverseRecurse:
This program runs in the terminal.
The user can run this program by first opening the terminal, entering the
directory using the command "cd pa7", compiling the program using the command
"javac ReverseRecurse.java",
and finally running the program using the command
"java TestReverseRecurse".

When opened, the user is asked to input the number of integers they wish to 
enter. If the user enters a value that is too small, an error message pops up
and the user can try again. If the user enters a valid input, a new set of 
instructions pops up, instructing the user to enter integers up to the number
of integers they originally wanted to enter. The integers the user inputs is
then stored. The integers can then be printed in the order they were entered
and they can also be reversed.


Slots:
This program sets up an AppletViewer window which the user can manipulate.
The user can run this program by first opening the terminal, entering the
directory using the command "cd pa7", compiling the program using the command
"javac -cp ./objectdraw.jar:. Slots.java",
and finally running the program using the command
"appletviewer Slots.html".

When opened, the user is faced with three slot wheels with random images, and
a button that says "Click to Spin". If the button is pressed, the slot wheels
will start spinning (the images will start changing). The goal is to have all 
the slot wheels land on the same image. If all the wheels end on the same
image, the user has won and an image celebrating the win will appear. Near the 
bottom of the screen, the program records and shows the number of spins
(which will increase whenever the button is pressed), the number of wins
(which will increase whenever the wheels land on the same image), and the
win percentage (the amount of wins compared to the number of spins).


Short Answer: 
1) :set shiftwidth=2 -> sets indent to two spaces
   N>> -> indents N number of lines
   N<< -> deindent N number of lines
2) >% -> indent block
   <% -> deindent block
3) o
4) 1>>output
5) int[] array = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
