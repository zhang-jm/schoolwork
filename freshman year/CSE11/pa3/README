Short Response:
1) You can jump to a specific line in vim by using the command 
":[insert line number]". So, if you wanted to go to line 20, you would type 
the command ":20". Alternatively, you could type "[insert line number]G"
(example: 20G).
2) The command to set auto-indentation is ":set autoindent". The command to 
turn off auto-indentation is ":set noautoindent".
3) The command to undo changes is simply "u".
4) In command mode, you can move forward one word in a line of code by typing
"w". You can move backward one word in a line of code by typing "b".
